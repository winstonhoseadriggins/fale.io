OpenStack is a system that controls large pools of computing and networking resources, along with cloud storage, allowing its users to provision resources through a user-friendly interface.
OpenStack helps developers with features such as rolling upgrades, federated identity, and software reliability.

You will begin with basic security policies, such as MAC, MLS, and MCS, and explore the structure of OpenStack and virtual networks with Neutron.
Next, you will configure secure communications on the OpenStack API with HTTP connections.
You will also learn how to set OpenStack Keystone and OpenStack Horizon and gain a deeper understanding of the similarities/differences between OpenStack Cinder and OpenStack Swift.

By the end of this book, you will be able to take full control of your hypervisor to make it safer and a smart choice based on your needs.
You can be confident that your cloud storage and wider pool of resources will be secure from today's many security threats.
